      title: 'How to Trade EUR/USD in 2025',
      category: 'Forex',
      date: 'March 15, 2025',
      excerpt: 'Master the most traded currency pair with our comprehensive guide to EUR/USD trading strategies.',
      body: 'EUR/USD remains the world\'s most liquid currency pair, accounting for nearly 25% of daily forex volume. Successful traders watch ECB and Fed policy divergence, key technical levels around the 1.05–1.12 range, and macro releases like NFP and Eurozone CPI. Build a structured plan: identify the trend on the daily chart, refine entries on the 1H/15M, and always size positions so a single loss never exceeds 1–2% of your account. Combine this with disciplined risk management and you have an edge that compounds over months.',

      title: 'Understanding Leverage and Margin',
      category: 'Strategy',
      date: 'March 12, 2025',
      excerpt: 'Learn how leverage works, its benefits, risks, and how to use it effectively in your trading.',
      body: 'Leverage lets you control a large position with a small deposit — a 1:500 leverage means $1,000 of margin controls $500,000 of notional exposure. The upside is amplified returns; the downside is amplified losses. Margin call kicks in when account equity falls below 30% of used margin, and stop-out triggers at 0%. Treat leverage as a tool, not a multiplier: most professionals use only 5–10x effective leverage even when 500x is available. Always size positions based on stop-loss distance and account risk — never based on what leverage allows.',

      title: 'Top 5 Forex Strategies for Beginners',
      category: 'Forex',
      date: 'March 10, 2025',
      excerpt: 'Start your trading journey right with these proven strategies designed for new traders.',
      body: 'Five strategies that work for beginners: (1) Trend-following on the 4H chart using 50/200 EMAs; (2) Support/resistance bounces at key round numbers; (3) Breakout trading after consolidation patterns; (4) News fade trades after high-impact releases; (5) Carry trades on positive interest-rate differentials. Pick ONE and master it for 3 months before adding another. Track every trade in a journal with screenshots and notes. The traders who succeed are not the ones with the most strategies — they are the ones who consistently execute one strategy with discipline.',

      title: 'What Moves Gold Prices?',
      category: 'News',
      date: 'March 8, 2025',
      excerpt: 'Discover the key factors that influence gold prices and how to trade this precious metal.',
      body: 'Gold prices respond to four primary drivers: (1) US dollar strength — gold is priced in USD, so a stronger dollar typically means lower gold; (2) Real interest rates — when inflation-adjusted yields rise, gold loses appeal as a non-yielding asset; (3) Geopolitical risk — gold is the classic safe haven during crises; (4) Central bank demand — emerging-market central banks have been net buyers for over a decade. To trade gold effectively, watch the DXY, 10-year TIPS yields, and the geopolitical headline flow. Spot prices typically move within $20–40 per day.',

      title: 'Getting Started with Copy Trading',
      category: 'Platforms',
      date: 'March 5, 2025',
      excerpt: 'Learn how to follow expert traders and automatically replicate their strategies on SwisDex.',
      body: 'Copy trading lets you mirror the trades of experienced traders automatically — when they open a position, the same trade fires in your account, scaled to your allocated capital. On SwisDex, browse the leader board sorted by long-term return, max drawdown, and win rate. Allocate a portion of your capital (never all of it) and choose 3–5 leaders with different strategies (trend, scalping, swing) for diversification. Review monthly: keep what works, drop what does not. Copy trading is not passive income — it is active portfolio management of human strategies.',

      title: 'Risk Management: The Key to Long-Term Success',
      category: 'Strategy',
      date: 'March 1, 2025',
      excerpt: 'Protect your capital and maximize profits with proper risk management techniques.',
      body: 'The single biggest difference between traders who survive and those who blow up: position sizing. Rule one — never risk more than 1–2% of your account on a single trade. Rule two — always set a stop-loss BEFORE entering, never after. Rule three — keep a 1:2 minimum reward-to-risk ratio so even a 40% win rate is profitable. Rule four — never add to a losing position; that is how small losses become account-killers. Rule five — log every trade and review monthly. The market will pay you to be disciplined and punish you for being greedy. There is no exception.',
