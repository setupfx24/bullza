          <Section title="1. Leverage Risk">
            SwisDex offers leverage up to 1:500 on certain instruments. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. A small adverse price movement can result in substantial losses or even the complete loss of your deposit.
            <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 mt-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
              <strong className="text-gray-800">Example:</strong> With 1:100 leverage, a 1% adverse price movement results in a 100% loss of your margin.
